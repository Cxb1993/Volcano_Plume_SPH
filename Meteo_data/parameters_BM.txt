Output variables and file format    
As output you should produce an ASCII text file containing the following variables as a  function of z (or print only the ones that are available from you model):    z (height in m) on I column  r (plume radius in m) on II column  hp-‐x (x-‐position of plume axis in m) on III column  hp-‐y (y-‐position of plume axis in m) on IV column  rho (plume density in kg/m^3) on V column  temp (plume temperature in oC) on VI column  vel (plume velocity in m/s) on VII column  mf-‐a (entrained air mass fraction) on VIII column  mf-‐g (gas mass fraction) on IX column  mf-‐p (coarse pyroclasts mass fraction) on X column  mf-‐p (fine pyroclasts mass fraction) on X IIcolumn    Beside such a file you should provide Mass Flow Rate (for the exercises where you fix  Column Height) and Column Height (for the exercises where you fix Mass Flow Rate).    Plume radius and related variables need to be calculated perpendicular to the plume  axis.  3D models need to provide cross-‐section averages of  the  same  quantities  considering integrals up  to  distances where  density is  1%  of  the  its  maximum value.
