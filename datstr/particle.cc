 * No matter which kind of particle I am creating, the second variable should be a function of primitive variable

 * This is not good, I should double check and try to make the sure that secondary variable computed is consistent with these given.
 *
 * So the following constructor should be replaced by some function in the future
 *
 * Well, because the density is determine later by SPH summation, so computing of secondary variables from primitive is not feasible!!!
 * Actually, energy, pressure, density and mass will be determined in initial_air(), secondary variable updating will also be called there.
